# Relearning Vue.js - Build a Robot

This project is a personal endeavor to relearn Vue.js after a two-year hiatus, using a tutorial by Jim Cooper, whose
GitHub account is [jmcooper](https://github.com/jmcooper). The primary goal is to build a robot-themed web application, aptly named "Build a Robot." As
you progress through this project, you'll refresh your knowledge of Vue.js and reinforce your front-end development
skills.

## Introduction

Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building interactive web applications. It's known for its simplicity, ease
of use, and a robust ecosystem. This project will guide you through relearning Vue.js by creating a fun and engaging web
application where users can customize and assemble their own virtual robots.

## Project Overview

The "Build a Robot" project is a simple web application where users can:

- Customize the appearance of a robot.
- Choose different parts and accessories.
- View the robot in real-time as they make changes.
- Save and share their custom robot configurations.

This project will allow you to explore various Vue.js features, including components, directives, state management, and
event handling. You will also dive into handling user interactions and updating the UI dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: The core framework for building the web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For scripting and logic.
- **Vue CLI**: If needed, to set up your Vue.js project quickly.
- **[Additional libraries or tools as needed]**

## Project Structure

The project structure can be organized as follows:

````
build-a-robot/
|-- public/
| |-- index.html
|-- src/
| |-- assets/
| |-- components/
| |-- App.vue
| |-- main.js
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- 
````

This is a basic structure, and you can expand it as your project requirements grow.
